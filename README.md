# Industrial AI Optimization Toolkit

A collection of AI/ML tools and experiments aimed at optimizing processes in the Manufacturing and Energy sectors. This repository features data-driven workflows, predictive maintenance models, abnormal detection, process simulations, and optimization algorithms built with Python and open-source libraries.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This toolkit demonstrates how machine learning and data science can be applied to:
- Improve efficiency in manufacturing operations
- Predict equipment failures using sensor data
- Optimize energy consumption and load balancing
- Apply reinforcement learning to control systems
- Data Driven Control

Each module is designed to be modular, reproducible, and scalable for deployment in industrial environments.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ End-to-end ML pipelines
- ✅ Predictive maintenance with real-world datasets (e.g. NASA CMAPSS)
- ✅ Process optimization using reinforcement learning
- ✅ Visualizations and dashboards for operational insights
- ✅ Integration with SCADA-simulated environments
